# datathon-25-notebooks
This repo contains notebooks I wrote for the BTK Datathon 25 competition on Kaggle. It was my **first Datathon competition**, and the main goal was to **predict the session_value** of e-commerce user sessions based on their event histories (e.g., views, add-to-cart, purchases, etc.)

## My Result
- Final Rank: **125th out of 571 teams**  
- Final Score: **491 (private leaderboard)**  

Although this was a private competition, it was a valuable first experience for me in handling real-world style data, practicing feature engineering, and competing on a Kaggle leaderboard.

## Contents
- Jupyter notebooks used for data preparation, model training, and submission generation.
